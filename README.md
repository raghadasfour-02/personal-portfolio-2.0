# Raghad's Personal Portfolio
A portfolio to broadcast my work experience, projects, and a little more about me. 
---
### Inspiration
Initially, I created my personal portfolio using mostly HTML/CSS (Boostrap). To learn React, I decided to challenge myself to replicate my pre-existing site (with additional improvements) using React.
### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
- React (and that it's pretty awesome)
- React Virtual DOM
- React's State and Lifecycle
- React Hooks
### What did I learn? [ABOUT SOFTWARE]
- React's reusable components make the design process significantly more efficient and allows for deduplication of code fragments (often an issue I ran into with my previous predominantly HTML/CSS site)
- The React Component Lifecycle (Mounting, Updating, Unmounting)
